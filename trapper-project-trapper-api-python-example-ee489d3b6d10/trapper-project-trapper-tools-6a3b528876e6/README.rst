Trapper tools
*************

With TRAPPER we provide tools that facilitate processing of large collections of raw camera trapping data. To convert video files into one of the two web-friendly video formats (mp4, webm) we provided a python script **convert_media.py**. To generate multimedia data packages that can be further uploaded to a server and processed by TRAPPER we provided another python script **generate_package.py**. To setup this process properly all data should be stored in one directory (e.g. project) with collections of recorded files (e.g. recording sessions) as its sub-directories. Each collection can optionally have another level of sub-directories aggregating data into deployments (e.g. an array of camera traps deployed during a session) with names of these directories corresponding to codes of deployments as defined in TRAPPER database (step 1 in importing data). Generated data packages are .zip files with accompanying package definition files (YAML) which are used by TRAPPER to automatically link uploaded files to corresponding deployments and to update database with records primary metadata. These data packages can be uploaded to a server through a web interface or directly (FTP, SSH) to a dedicated directory associated with a user profile.
